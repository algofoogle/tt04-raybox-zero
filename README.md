# raybox-zero for TT04 (Tiny Tapeout 04)

This is an attempt to create a design for TT04 that is a very simple ray caster demo (sort of like Wolf3D rendering) driving a VGA display without a framebuffer (i.e. by 'racing the beam').

For more information, see the main source repo for this project: [algofoogle/raybox-zero]
