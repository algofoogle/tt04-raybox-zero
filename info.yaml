# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    0        # 0, because we're not using a Wokwi project.

  # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately.
  #NOTE: Most sources are from the raybox-zero git submodule, hence the longer paths:
  source_files:
    - top.v

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# Keep a track of the submission yaml

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
